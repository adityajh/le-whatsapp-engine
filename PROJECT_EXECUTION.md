## 🔵 PHASE 1 — RULES ENGINE v3 (26 March 2026)
> **Goal:** Complete Rules Engine v3 implementation, Zoho setup, and end-to-end testing.
> **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE. Engine live. E2E delivery confirmed 27 Mar 2026.

- [x] **P1.1 — Fix `wa_state` overwrite on re-upsert**
- [x] **P1.2 — Update Storysells branch in workflow graph**
- [x] **P1.3 — Zoho webhook field mapping** (Multi-source: JSON, form-encoded. Mobile > Phone fallback.)
- [x] **P1.4 — Run Supabase migrations on production**
- [x] **P1.5 — Verify `ButtonPayload` field name from Twilio** (Logging added)
- [x] **P1.6 — Set up Zoho API credentials (OAuth Self-Client)**
- [ ] **P1.7 — Create Zoho custom fields on Leads module** ← **User Action Pending**
  - **Core WA fields**: `WA_Opt_In` (Checkbox), `WA_State` (Single-line), `WA_Hotness` (Picklist), `WA_Reply_Class` (Picklist), `WA_Last_Inbound_At` (DateTime)
  - **New field**: `WA_Track` (Picklist: enterprise_leadership/family_business/venture_builder)
- [x] **P1.8 — Implement core Zoho writeback** (Activated in `inboundProcessor.ts`)
- [x] **P1.9 — Dynamic template SID resolution** — All 3 previously pending templates now confirmed approved. Engine uses live Twilio Content API lookup; no hardcoded SIDs.
- [x] **P1.10 — End-to-end test** — Confirmed 27 Mar 2026. Twilio accepted message. Meta 63049 error = marketing category on test number (not a code bug).

---

## 🟣 PHASE 2 — ADMIN CONTROL & VISIBILITY (27 March 2026) ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **P2.1 — Global Engine Toggle (Kill Switch)**
  - `system_settings` table migration + `EngineToggle` component + `/api/admin/settings` API
  - Both Zoho and Twilio webhooks check `engine_enabled` before any processing
- [x] **P2.2 — Zoho Field Mapping page** (`/admin/zoho-mapping`)
  - Internal key ↔ Zoho merge tag reference table + recommended JSON payload
- [x] **P2.3 — Admin Dashboard update** — Zoho Mapping card added to grid
- [x] **P2.4 — Template cache persistence** — Removed 1-hour TTL; templates persist until manual Refresh
- [x] **P2.5 — Dispatcher safety layer** — Final SID resolution in `dispatchMessage()` before Twilio call


---

## 🟢 PHASE 3.3 — ANALYTICS & BUG FIXES (27 March 2026) ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **P3.3.1 — Analytics page 2-tab rewrite** (`/admin/analytics`)
  - Tab 1 (Template Performance): added `error_code` column, `topError` per template, plain-English error labels
  - Tab 2 (Message Log): per-message log with lead name + masked phone, status badge, error code, timestamps, filter pills
  - Next.js 16: `searchParams` awaited as Promise in server component props
- [x] **P3.3.2 — Messages table migration** (`20260327_messages_error_code.sql`)
  - Added `error_code VARCHAR(20)` and `phone_normalised VARCHAR(20)` columns
  - Added performance indexes: `idx_messages_status`, `idx_messages_phone`, `idx_messages_sent_at`
- [x] **P3.3.3 — Dispatcher field name fix** (CRITICAL — messages table empty since Week 1)
  - `body` → `content`, `created_at` → `sent_at` in outbound message insert
  - Added `phone_normalised` to insert for cooldown enforcement
- [x] **P3.3.4 — Inbound processor fixes** (CRITICAL — inbound replies never processed)
  - Phone normalisation: strip all non-digits first, then pattern-match 12-digit vs 10-digit
  - Message insert: `body` → `content`, `created_at` → `sent_at`, added `lead_id`
  - `lead_events` insert: removed non-existent `phone_normalised`, added `lead_id`
- [x] **P3.3.5 — Inbound webhook URL fix** — Reconstructed from `x-forwarded-proto` + `x-forwarded-host` headers for correct Twilio signature validation in Vercel serverless
- [x] **P3.3.6 — Twilio console config** — Set inbound webhook URL in Messaging Service → Integration tab (was blank)
- [x] **P3.3.7 — Backfill script** (`scripts/backfill-messages.ts`) — idempotent fetch from Twilio API to populate historical messages. Confirmed 7 messages inserted.
- **Result:** Full E2E confirmed 27 Mar 2026: outbound send → Twilio delivery callback → inbound reply → classify → auto-reply (wa_counsellor_intro).

---

## 🟠 PHASE 3 — NEXT SPRINT

- [ ] **P2.1 — Follow-up cron deduplication**
  - Set new `wa_state` atomically *before* enqueuing in Rules 5 & 6 (not after).
  - Prevents a lead from being matched again on the next cron run while still in the dispatch queue.

- [ ] **P2.2 — Rule 6 double-send guard**
  - Add `wa_last_outbound_at < wa_last_inbound_at` check to Rule 6 query.
  - Prevents a lead who already received `wa_track_selector` from also getting `wa_followup_2_quickreply` 48h later.

- [ ] **P2.3 — Named flow save/open in Logic Builder**
  - Allow multiple `workflow_rules` rows. One row `is_active = true` evaluated at runtime.
  - UI additions: flow list panel (list / open / duplicate / create new), active/draft toggle, flow name editing.
  - Enables versioning and A/B draft testing of routing logic.

- [ ] **P2.4 — Editable button payload map**
  - Admin UI (similar to `/admin/classification`) where button postback IDs are mapped to reply class, hotness, state transition, and special actions (`lead_track`, `webinar_rsvp`, counsellor flag).
  - Eliminates code change requirement for every new quick reply template.

- [ ] **P2.5 — Campaign reply awareness**
  - Use `wa_last_template` in `inboundProcessor` to suppress specific downstream actions for campaign-originated replies.
  - Specifically: `WEBINAR_YES` tap → flag counsellor but do NOT auto-send `wa_counsellor_intro` (counsellor sends joining details manually).

- [ ] **P2.6 — Expanded Zoho writeback**
  - After outbound send: write `WA_State`, `WA_Last_Outbound_At`, `WA_Last_Template`.
  - On track selector tap: write `WA_Track` picklist value.
  - On hot lead: create Zoho Task ("Call [Name] — WA Hot Lead", due in 2h, assigned to owner).

- [ ] **P2.7 — Storysells proper template**
  - Create a Storysells-specific WhatsApp template in Twilio and get it approved.
  - Update Logic Builder routing: `program = Storysells` → new Storysells template (replace `wa_welcome_manual` placeholder).

---

## ⚪ PHASE 3 — FUTURE

- [ ] **P3.1 — Multiple independent flows**
  - Support more than one active flow evaluated in parallel (e.g., BBA Pune flow, Storysells flow).
  - `rulesEngine.ts` selects the right flow based on a top-level lead field (e.g., `program`).

- [ ] **P3.2 — End node differentiation**
  - Different outcomes for different End nodes in the graph.
  - Currently all End nodes behave identically (`wa_manual_triage`).
  - Future: silent skip, Zoho task, email alert, SMS fallback — configurable per End node.

- [ ] **P3.3 — CSV import for contacts campaigns**
  - Admin UI to upload a CSV of contacts into a temporary Supabase table (`contacts_import`).
  - Columns: phone, name, and any segment fields.
  - Campaigns can target this table in addition to the existing `leads` table.

- [ ] **P3.4 — Contacts campaign runner**
  - Campaign creation UI supports selecting source: existing `leads` (with filters) or an imported `contacts_import` batch.
  - Rate-limiting, dispatch queue, and delivery tracking apply equally to both.

- [ ] **P3.5 — Lead data strategy review**
  - Formal review of long-term Supabase vs Zoho data model.
  - Current model (Supabase = WA state mirror, Zoho = source of truth) works well.
  - Review once Zoho writeback is mature and volume is clear.

| 16 | 27 Mar | Inbound replies never processed — NLP classifier and state machine unreachable | Code Agent + Ops | ✅ Resolved | Three causes: (1) Twilio Messaging Service Integration tab had blank inbound URL — set to production URL. (2) Phone normalisation stripped `+` before E.164 check → no lead found. (3) `lead_events` insert referenced non-existent column. All three fixed. |
| 17 | 27 Mar | Twilio signature validation blocked inbound in Vercel serverless | Code Agent | ✅ Resolved | `req.url` returns internal Vercel hostname — doesn't match Twilio's signed URL. Fixed by reconstructing from `x-forwarded-proto` + `x-forwarded-host` headers. |
